1.    What is your understanding of blockchain?
Ans.  -Blockchain is a decentralized & distributed system which uses the cryptography technquies to store the data in the chains of blocks.   
      -It is a constantly growing ledger (database) that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions.
      -It's more secure, immutable, verifiable & tamper-proof than traditional method of transaction.
 
2.  What is the core problem block chain trying to solve? 
Ans.  *Data insecurity
      *Authentication
      *Dependency on Centralized System
      *Data manipulation
      
3.   What are the few features which bock chain will give you?
Ans.  *Decentralisation
      *Data security
      *Verifiablity
      *Data transparency
      *Tamper-Proof 
      *Immutable
      
4.   What all things does a block contain?
Ans. *Block number
     *Transaction / data records
     *Previous Block Signature
     *Mining key
 
5.  How is verifiability of blockchain is been attained?
Ans. Blockchain is based on distributed database & it's rarely possible to change the data on all the systems at a same time within 10 seconds.
     If one's Security key is different than others that means there is some error in data record on that particular system and 
     it's get improved or corrected with the help of others system.
